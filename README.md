# LC-3b tools

Here are some tools I have written related to the [LC-3b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3) (Little Computer 3b),
which is a simple CPU architecture intended as a teaching tool.

* [disassembler](./disassembler/) (written in C99)
* [assembler](./assembler/) (INCOMPLETE) (written in C99)


## The book

The LC-3 was described in the book [Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits and Gates to C and Beyond, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computing-Systems-Gates-Beyond/dp/0072467509) [(errata)](http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/information_center_view0/errata_page.html).
The LC-3b appears to be the nearly the same CPU, but is byte-addressable and adds a bit-shifting instruction.
